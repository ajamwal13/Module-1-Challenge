THe company is funded by prominent tech investors including Elon Musk and Sam Altam as well as large tech organizations such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. OpenAI has raised over $11.3 billion over 8 funding rounds. A majority of this funding was received from Microsoft which invested $1 billion in 2019 and a subsequent $10 billion in 2023. 

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?  
This company is trying to solve the problem of equal access to AI for everyone, thus the name Open AI. The company is directly addressing concerns over AI safety and is committed to developing AI that could benefit society. The company aims to solve the problem of AI safety by providing AI for all. Under the umbrella of this large problem are many subproblems the company is trying to solve such as improving the efficiency of content moderation.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  
OpenAI’s intended customer is the general human population. Because of OpenAI’s wide ranging motive and goal, its intended consumer is just as general. OpenAI intends to solve the problem of AI and its risks to humanity. Therefore OpenAI’s consumer is humanity or any person on Earth. THis is because OpenAI intends to make AI accessible to everyone on Earth.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)  
OpenAI offers a strong ethical and moral backbone for AI development that many other AI companies cannot boast. OpenAI’s endeavors are all rooted in strong ethical and moral values centered around protecting humanity and ensuring equal access to AI for all. THat has been OpenAI’s mission from the beginning and will continue to pave the way for OpenAI’s future successes.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)  
OpenAI is implementing a plethora of technologies primarily centered around reinforcement learning. For example, OpenAI FIve is a collection of five AI virtual bots that can compete in the online virtual game Dota 2. OpenAI has trained these bots up to the point that they can compete with world class teams. In addition, OpenAI has developed several unsupervised transformer language models known as GPTs. The newest version, known as GPT-4 was capable of passing the BAR exam unlike previous version of GPT.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?  
This company is in the field of AI in general, or more specifically AGI, which is artificial general intelligence.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?  
There have been major trends such as the trend of self driving cars, which uses AI technology. In addition, there has been increased interest in the potential uses for AI in healthcare, including drug research, patient outcome, and medical imaging.

* What are the other major companies in this field?  
Google, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?  
One business impact of OpenAI has been the improvement of customer service chatbots. Using OpenAI generative text technology, chatbots can perform 24/7, increase customer satisfaction, and resolve problems quicker. Another business impact is content creation. Using OpenAI technology such as Dall.e, consumers can generate images and pictures based on text. This saves time and resources for content creation in businesses. A third business impact is cost reduction of marketing. OpenAI technology makes managing ad campaigns and results more efficient.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?  
One major core metric is ethical and moral standards. On this metric OpenAI scores very high as they pride themselves on maintaining a strict ethical and moral background based on providing equal access to AI to all, and protecting humankind from the dangers of AI.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?  
The company is performing very well in comparison to its competitors. OpenAI boasts a net worth of over $29 billion. OpenAI major competitors include Google, Amazon, Intel, all of which are highly established organizations which have much greater net worths than OpenAI. SInce OpenAI is relatively new, its performance appears lower than that of these other companies if based on net worth alone.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)  
I would offer services that specifically target those of the disabled population. This includes blind people and deaf people as well as amputees and more. These people need assistance just so that their quality of life can be equal to that of a normal person. Using AI the lives of these individuals can be improved and made better so that they don't have to experience any of the pains of being disabled.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?  
Offering this product would benefit this company as it would support their ethos of making AI accessible by providing services to disabled persons. This is a large market and therefore large revenue can be made from servicing this market. In addition, AI technology is curated in such a way that already existing technologies can greatly help this population with little to no effort made in developing the products as they already exist.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?  
This technology would use text generative technology such as chat gpt to translate films and other video sources. THis technology would utilize audio translation AI technology used in chatbots such as Alexa and google home to interpret audio information. This would also include image detection software used to detect what objects are within an image.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?  
THese technologies are all appropriate for my solution because they all cater towards disabled peoples.For example, the textgenerative technology can be used for those who cannot read and need translation. THe image detection technology can be used for those who cannot see and need assistance visualizing the environment. THe audio translation AI technology can be used for those who cannot hear and need interpretation of what is being said in the environment.
